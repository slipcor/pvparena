## Description

This activates Flags (to set), per team. Team A captures the flag of team B and brings it home. To do this, simply break the flag block and click your flag when holding the flag block!
## Setup

Flags have to be added.In order to do that, use `/pa [arenaname] [teamname]flag` - this enables setting. 

Do this by clicking the flag type (WOOL by default). Don't click with your wand, 
just click with your hand or anything else.

You can activate a special "touchdown" way of playing. Set a flag called "touchdown", it will be BLACK ingame. Players claim this flag and bring it home. 

Only one team can bring this flag home, obviously :)

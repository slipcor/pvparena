# Liberation

## Description

A medium complex game mode. Dead players are teleported to the killer team's jail. 
They can be unjailed, liberated, get one life back, so to speak :)

## Setup

You have to add spawns for the jails, set them like every other spawn (bluejail, redjail) and on top of that, 
you have to set a button that will trigger the liberation of jailed players. 

It needs to be a stone block, and you set it with `/pa [arenaname] [teamname]button` \- Set it by clicking the button.

# Infect

## Description

Quite simple. A random player is infected, he can have special gear and it's everyone against that player. 
Killing an infected player kicks him out of the game, killing a non infected player infects him. 
Either the infected win by killing everyone else, or the other way round. 

## Setup

At least one special "infected" spawn has to be set. You know how to do that, right? `/pa [arena] spawn infected*`

The other spawns are set like the standard free for all goals, with spawns named like spawn1 through spawn10 or alike.

You can set a class called "%infected%" in order to give infected players special gear

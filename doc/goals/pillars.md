# Pillars
## Description

This activates pillars being defined by a wool block / pillar. People can then click/destroy them. Future versions will include actually physically bringing pillar blocks to your base to score
## Setup

You have to define pillars. Prepare a WOOL block, this will be the base of the pillar. This base will be the operational block and will react to:

- clicking
- breaking
- placing against 

(based on your settings)

In order to do that, use /pa [arenaname] [teamname]pillar* - this enables setting. Finally set the block by clicking the WOOL block.

Note that there are three kinds of pillars:

- empty pillar
  - starts empty (duh ;) )
  - gains points for everyone, when claimed
  - naming: Any name containing "pillar" and NOT containing a team name! 
- team pillar (filled)
  - starts with the predefined fill height, claimed by the team name
  - gains no points for the initial claimed team
  - naming: Any name starting with the team name and containing "pillar" 
- team pillar (not filled)
  - starts empty, only gives points to the team name contained, if claimed
  - naming: Any name not starting with the team name, containing pillar, and containing the team name that should NOT get points

# Turrets

## Description

This mod adds preparations for TURRETS! The only thing you need is a pressure plate. The rest is optional. Note that projectiles are spawned over your head, 2 blocks over your head to be precise :)

To use the turret, step on the plate (during a match) and click. Aim where the projectile should aim at, just remember that your angle is the same, just 3 blocks higher, so you might eventually have to aim down a bit ;)

## Installation

Unzip the module files (files tab, "PA Files v*.*.*") into the /pvparena/files folder and install them via

- `/pa install [modname]`, activate per arena via
- `/pa [arenaname] !tm [modname]`

## Setup

Set spawns, they have to contain "turret" (duh ;) ) and may contain the type if you want to do something apart from arrows. 

To be sure you're doing it right, place the pressure plate beforehand and then stand on it to set the spawn. 

The following texts define a type:

- fire \- fireball
- snow \- snowball
- large \- large fireball
- small \- small fireball
- wither \- wither skull 


## Config settings

- maxdegrees \- the angle (in degrees ;) ) that people are allowed to look left and right, defaults to 90
- mininterval \- the minimum ticks that a player has to wait before using the turret again (0 = off)

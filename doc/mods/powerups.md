# PowerUps

## Description

This mod allows spawning of items that give special powers / bad things, fully customizable

## Installation

Unzip the module files (files tab, "PA Files v*.*.*") into the /pvparena/files folder and install them via

- `/pa modules install powerups`, activate per arena via
- `/pa [arenaname] !tm powerups`

## Setup

Sorry, but you have to add a freaking block to your arena config under `module.powerups.items`. E.g.:

```yaml

    - factor: 4.0
    - duration: 10

    - diff: -1

  - portal:
    - duration: 10
- Rage:
  - item: ROTTEN_FLESH
  - dmg_cause:
    - factor: 0.0
    - chance: 0.2
    - duration: 5
- Berserk:
  - item: CACTUS
  - dmg_cause:
    - factor: 1.5
    - duration: 5
  - dmg_receive:
    - dactor: 1.5
    - duration: 5
- Healing:
  - item: APPLE
  - heal:
    - factor: 1.5
    - duration: 10
- Heal:
  - item: BREAD
  - health:
    - diff: 3
- Repair:
  - item: WORKBENCH
  - repair:
    - items: helmet,chestplate,leggins,boots
    - factor: 0.2
```

So the first layer defines the name, the second layer defines item and adds all the effects it has. This example features all possible ways of doing good and bad things, I hope it is clear oO

## Config settings

- dropspawn \- should the powerup spawn require defined spawns? `/pa [arena] spawn powerupX` (where X is an integer)
- usage \- by default it is "off", so please set this to either every X kills ("death:X") or every X seconds ("time:X") 

## Commands


- `/pa [arena] !pu time 6` \- spawn every 6 seconds
- `/pa [arena] !pu death 4` \- spawn every 4 kills

## Setup

The mod needs a full server restart to properly alter the configuration. After the restart, you will see a configuration block, as described below. The chests will be filled with a random itemstack count between min and max. So the default will spam items 1-10, 0-5 out of those. There is a rare chance that the same item will be given twice, this chance increases when lowering the items or rising the max count.

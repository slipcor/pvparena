# ArenaBoards
## Description

This mod adds possibility to add arena boards to the game!
## Installation

Unzip the module files (files tab, "PA Files v*.*.*") into the /pvparena/files folder and install them via
- `/pa install [modname]`, activate per arena via
- `/pa [arenaname] !tm [modname]`
## Setup

Start by placing signs that should display the content, mostly 2 rows and approx 6 colums, depending on how many colums you want to have. 

Then, add the headlines (i.e. place a sign and fill its FIRST line with a column headline), but place the top left sign LAST !! 

The top left sign has to have the first line in the shape of "[PAA]" and append the arena name, if you want an arena based sign. (e.g. "[PAA]spleef" if the arena is called "spleef")

Valid column heads are:

- "[PA]WINS" \- column shows matches won
- "[PA]LOSSES" \- column shows matches lost
- "[PA]DEATHS" \- column shows deaths
- "[PA]KILLS" \- column shows kills
- "[PA]MAXDAMAGE" \- column shows aximal damage dealt
- "[PA]MAXDAMAGETAKE" \- column shows maximal damage taken
- "[PA]DAMAGE" \- column shows total damage dealt
- "[PA]DAMAGETAKE" \- column shows total damage taken
- anything else \- column shows player names

### Why are there different statuses?

PVP Arena exists since 2011 and Minecraft servers evolution make modules follow-up complicated. The objective of next
updates will be to make a great check-up of all of them and fix all eventual issues.

Anyway, don't hesitate to test legacy modules by yourself, a big part of them work normally or have trivial issues. Obviously
if you encounter one, you can [report it](https://github.com/Eredrim/pvparena/issues) 😉

## Installing modules

### Download the module pack

> ℹ This has to be done only once
 
Use the [`/pa modules download`](commands/modules.md) command to download the release version of modules. If you want to
install a dev build version, download the zip archive on [jenkins](https://ci.craftyn.com/job/PVP%20Arena%20Modules/) 
and deflate it in the `/files` directory of pvparena.

After this step, if you type [`/pa modules list`](commands/modules.md), you will show the list of all installable 
modules.

### Installing a module

> ℹ This has to be done for each module you want to install

Modules aren't loaded by default, a quick installation is required. 
Type [`/pa modules install [moduleName]`](commands/modules.md) to install one of them.


### Enable a module for an arena

> ℹ This has to be done for each arena

Last step: your module is installed and you want to use it in some of your arenas. 
Type [`/pa [arena] !tm [moduleName]`](commands/togglemod.md) to enable it in your arena.

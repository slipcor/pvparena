# Create command

## Description

The create command basically creates a standard, boring, arena. Given legacy types enhance this, but still you will probably want to customize your arena and definately continue setting it up by setting spawn points.

## Usage Examples

Command |  Definition
------------- | -------------
/pa create teamArena   | create a standard Teams Arena
/pa create capture ctf | create a Capture The Flag Arena called "capture"

## Details

In order to have a quicker start when setting up an arena, you can use the oldschool legacy types, which will be supported until v2.0 I guess. Those types add pre-definitions to define how the arena works in general. You can still go ahead and adjust the goal setup to your needs!

Valid legacy types include:

- ctf
- free
- ctp
- sabotage
- tank
- spleef

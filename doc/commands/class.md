# Class command

## Description

This command manages the arena classes. You can use it to show, edit and remove arena classes.

## Usage Examples

Command |  Definition
------------- | -------------
/pa test class load Tank   | Give you the class items of the Class "Tank" of the arena "test"
/pa temp class save Test   | Save your inventory to the class items of the Class "Test" of the arena "temp"
/pa team class remove Blue | Remove the class "Blue" from the arena "team"

## Hazards

Clear your inventory before doing that, to be sure that you don't save some of your current items to the class! You shouldn't do that when a game is running, and make sure that you /pa reload afterwards.

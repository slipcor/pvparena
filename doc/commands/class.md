# Class command

## Description

This command manages the arena classes. You can use it to show, edit and remove arena classes.

## Usage

Command |  Definition
------------- | -------------
/pa [arena] class load [class]   | Preview the class items of the class directly in your inventory
/pa [arena] class save [class]   | Save your inventory to the class items of a class
/pa [arena] class remove [class] | Remove a class from an arena

Example: use `/pa temp class save Test` to save your inventory to the class "Test" of the arena "temp"

> **🚩 Tip:**  
> Type `/pa leave` to leave class preview

## Hazards

Clear your inventory before doing that, to be sure that you don't save some of your current items to the class! You shouldn't do that when a game is running, and make sure that you /pa reload afterwards.

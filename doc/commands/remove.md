# Remove Command

## Description

This command does only one thing: Remove the arena.

## Usage

Command |  Definition
------------- | -------------
/pa [arena] remove | remove an arena


Example: `/pa test remove` - remove the "test" arena

## Hazards

Well, once you did that, the associated file is deleted. So when unsure, either make backups or use 
[disable](disable.md) command instead of remove.

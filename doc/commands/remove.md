# Remove Command

## Description

This command does only one thing: Remove the arena.

## Usage Examples

Command |  Definition
------------- | -------------
/pa test remove | remove the "test" arena
/pa temp remove | remove the "temp" arena

## Hazards

Well, once you did that, the file is gone. So when unsure, either make backups or use disable instead of remove.

## Todo

Maybe some day I'll add a confirmation that tells you about the fact that the arena will be gone "for a long time" ;)

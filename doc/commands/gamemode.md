/pa [arena] gamemode [team/free] | Change gamemode of an arena

Example: `/pa ffa gamemode free` - set the gamemode of arena "ffa" to "free"

The only real word needed is "free", everything else sets the arena to teams, because the only real free arena is the FREE arena, and, well, all others (except spleef which basically is a no-pvp-FFA) are team arena modes.

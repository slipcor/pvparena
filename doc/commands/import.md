# Import command

The import command tries to import arenas of version v0.8 and prior to the v1.0 file system.

## Usage Examples

Command |  Definition
------------- | -------------
/pa import | import all arenas
/pa import walls | import the arena called "walls"

## Hazards

We all make mistakes, so keep your eye on errors you see and check the configuration after the import has finished. Especially the activity of modules can NOT be imported correctly, sorry for that.

## Details

The command will tell you if an arena / which failed, sorry about that, maybe we can get into contact to sort this out. But I recon that you are quicker creating them again, from scratch ;)
Note that battlefield regions are GUESSED but might not be recognized. If they are, they receive all protections. 
So if you have issues after an import, it is probably the fact that all protections are re-enabled. For safety ;)

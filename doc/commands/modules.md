## Directory management

- `/mods` contains only mods used in arenas and installed by admins
- `/files` contains all downloaded mods

When you install a mod, the plugin copies it from `/files` to `/mods`.

plugins, green version numbers mark as up to date, red version numbers show that you need to update the files.

# PVP-Arena


**Enhance your server by adding a new dimension of PVP battles!**

Create fully customisable, moddable, flexible arenas, develop your own arena goal or mod that totally changes the game as you wish. 
This flexibility is achieved on the one hand by a module loader created by NodinChan which loads arena goals (/pvparena/goals) and arena mods (/pvparena/mods) which enhance the gameplay just limited by your imagination, on the other hand it features an API, which still is a WIP due to lack of requests. I will enhance it as feature/hook requests arise.

## What is PVP Arena?

PVP Arena is a plugin for Spigot based servers which enables creation of customizable fight and mini-games arenas.
Define your own teams, classes, lobbies, spawn points, messages, gear colors, rewards and even game modes!
Theses game modes (included in the plugin) can combined with tens of modules to enhance your gameplay!
In addition, all arenas can be protected with an embedded protection system based on regions.

Anyway, here's a quick (non exhaustive) list of plugin features:
- Multiple arenas
- Arena regions and protections
- Player-state saving
- Customizable classes
- Customizable spawn points, lobbies and spectator zones
- In-game configuration access and simple config files
- Arena disabling
- Scoreboards
- Spawn protection
- Flag coloring
- Inventory drops
- Announcements
- Time limited match
- Battlefield regeneration

So take time to read the docs, it's full of useful information 😉
